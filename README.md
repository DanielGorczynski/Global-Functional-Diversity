# Global-Functional-Diversity README
A variety of factors can affect the biodiversity of tropical mammal communities,
but their relative importance and directionality remain uncertain.
Previous global investigations of mammal functional diversity have relied
on range maps instead of observational data to determine community
composition. We test the effects of species pools, habitat heterogeneity, primary
productivity and human disturbance on the functional diversity
(dispersion and richness) of mammal communities using the largest standardized
tropical forest camera trap monitoring system, the Tropical Ecology
Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network. We use occupancy values
derived from the camera trap data to calculate occupancy-weighted functional
diversity and use Bayesian generalized linear regression to
determine the effects of multiple predictors. Mammal community functional
dispersion increased with primary productivity, while functional richness
decreased with human-induced local extinctions and was significantly
lower in Madagascar than other tropical regions. The significant positive
relationship between functional dispersion and productivity was evident
only when functional dispersion was weighted by speciesâ€™ occupancies.
Thus, observational data from standardized monitoring can reveal the
drivers of mammal communities in ways that are not readily apparent
from range map-based studies. The positive association between
occupancy-weighted functional dispersion of tropical forest mammal communities
and primary productivity suggests that unique functional traits
may be more beneficial in more productive ecosystems and may allow
species to persist at higher abundances.
